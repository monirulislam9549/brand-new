            <p>We are human being. Man is mortal. Man is best creation of Allah. Many people celebrate 2022 but they
                didn't
                realize we are one step ahead to death. They think this world full of enjoy period. But on
                Judgement Day
                Our
                Almighty Allah will decide how people will spend their afterlife</p>

                <h3>Microeconomics</h3>
                <h4 class="orange-colour">3rd semestar</h4>
                <p>Having said that, microeconomics does not try to answer or explain what forces should take place in a
                    market. Rather, it tries to explain what happens when there are changes in certain conditions.For
                    example, microeconomics examines how a company could maximize its production and capacity so that it
                    could lower prices and better compete. A lot of microeconomic information can be gleaned from
                    company
                    financial statements.</p>

                <h3>Macroeconomics</h3>
                <h4 class="orange-colour"> 4th semestar</h4>
                <p>Macroeconomics, on the other hand, studies the behavior of a country and how its policies impact the
                    economy as a whole. It analyzes entire industries and economies, rather than individuals or specific
                    companies, which is why it’s a top-down approach. It tries to answer questions such as “What should
                    the
                    rate of inflation be?” or “What stimulates economic growth?”</p>
